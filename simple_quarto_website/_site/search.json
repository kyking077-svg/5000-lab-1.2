    "text": "Tips for Farming\nMy favorite part of the game is the farming. I enjoy selecting crops for each season, running crop rotations, and creating the most efficient farm layout. The following sections will go through some basic things you should know about farming, so you can start setting up the systems you enjoy!\n\nTools\n\n\nYou start the game with a handful of tools. These tools are upgradeable, which will dramatically increase your productivity. The tools are:\n\n\n\nWatering can\nHoe\nScythe\nAxe\nPickaxe\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveling Up\nThere are five skills in Stardew Valley: Farming, Fishing, Foraging, Mining, and Combat. There are 10 levels in each, gained by taking actions related to the skill. Eacg time you level up, you get a little perk!\nAt levels 5 and 10, you get to choose which perk you gain, and adopt a “Profession.” Here is an example of the level progression in Farming:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Level 3] --&gt; B[Level 4]\n  B --&gt; C{Level 5}\n  C --&gt; D[Rancher Profession]\n  C --&gt; E[Tiller Profession]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrops\nThere are roughly 20 crops for each season, excluding winter. This table shows my favorite crops per season.\n\n\n\nSeason\nFavorite Fruit\nFavorite Vegetable\n\n\n\n\nSpring\nStrawberries\nPotatoes\n\n\nSummer\nBlueberries\nRed Cabbage\n\n\nFall\nCranberries\nPumpkins\n\n\nWinter\nPowder Melon\nWinter Root\n\n\n\nA common formula for players to use on their own is the Minimum Gold per Day (MGPD) formula, which evaluates the profit value of a crop based on it’s max harvests (MH), its sell price per harvest (S), its seed price (SP), and it’s growing days/growth rate (GD): \\(MGPD = \\frac{(MH × S)-SP}{GD}\\)\n\nWhen crops are harvested, they gain a quality score. This dictates how much gold you get from selling the crop, and has some other gameplay mechanics. It is calcualted in the game with the following equation:\n\\[\nQuality = 0.2 \\frac{FL}{10} + 0.2B \\frac{FL+2}{12} + 0.01\n\\]\n(FL = Farming level, and B = Fertilizer Boost)"

This is a great example of how your farm can evolve. The graphics are slightly different than base Stardew Valley, because this user has a modpack.\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag."
